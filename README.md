## Untitled LLM runtime project

A side project I worked on to learn about the inner magic of LLMs. I tried to mostly handwrite it so as to not miss out on the important details.

It is currently CPU only, so don't expect much speed. And Llama 2 is the only architecture that is supported as of now.
